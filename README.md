# TeXParser

The TeXParser is a standalone program designed to streamline the process of creating LaTeX documents from data stored in a database. It offers a convenient solution for users who need to generate documents such as reports, summaries, or academic papers from structured data.

## Features

- **Database Connectivity**: The program connects to various databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) to retrieve data efficiently.
  
- **Customizable Queries**: Users can specify custom SQL queries to fetch the desired data from the database.

- **Template-Based Document Generation**: The program generates LaTeX documents based on customizable templates through Python, allowing users to define the layout, formatting, and content structure of the resulting document.

- **Data Integration**: It seamlessly integrates database records into LaTeX document elements, such as tables, lists, and questionnaires.

- **Automation**: Users can automate the document generation process by scheduling periodic updates or triggering document creation based on specific events or conditions in the database.

- **Error Handling and Logging**: Intermediate error handling and logging mechanisms ensure the reliability and traceability of the document generation process.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

2. **Download and Install XAMPP:**

   Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. During the installation process, ensure that MySQL and phpMyAdmin are selected as components to be installed by checking their checkboxes.

3. **Configure Apache to Use the Repository:**

   - Navigate to your XAMPP installation folder.
   - Go to `apache` folder and then `conf`.
   - Open `httpd.conf` file with a text editor.
   - Locate the lines for `DocumentRoot` and `Directory` and change them to point to your repository's directory. For example:
     ```
     DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/repository"
     <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/repository">
     ```

4. **Start Apache and MySQL Services:**

   Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

5. **Access the Website:**

   Open your preferred web browser and navigate to `http://localhost` to access your website.

## Usage

1. **Connect to Database**: The user specifies the database connection details (e.g., host, port, credentials) and selects the desired database.

2. **Define Query**: The user provides a SQL query to extract the required data from the database. The query can be customized to filter, aggregate, or manipulate the data as needed.

3. **Configure Template**: The user defines a LaTeX template through Python that serves as the blueprint for the document. This template includes placeholders for dynamically inserted data elements.

4. **Generate Document**: The program executes the SQL query, retrieves the data from the database, and populates the LaTeX template with the fetched data. It generates a complete LaTeX document ready for compilation.

5. **Compile Document**: The program compiles the generated LaTeX document using `pdflatex` with a local LaTeX compiler (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX) to obtain the final output in PDF format.
