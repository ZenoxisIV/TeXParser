## Features

- **Database Connectivity**: The program connects to various databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) to retrieve data efficiently.
  
- **Customizable Queries**: Users can specify custom SQL queries to fetch the desired data from the database.

- **Template-Based Document Generation**: The program generates LaTeX documents based on customizable templates through Python, allowing users to define the layout, formatting, and content structure of the resulting document.

- **Data Integration**: It seamlessly integrates database records into LaTeX document elements, such as tables, lists, and questionnaires.

- **Automation**: Users can automate the document generation process by scheduling periodic updates or triggering document creation based on specific events or conditions in the database.

- **Error Handling and Logging**: Intermediate error handling and logging mechanisms ensure the reliability and traceability of the document generation process.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Download and Install XAMPP:**

   Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. During the installation process, ensure that MySQL and phpMyAdmin are selected as components to be installed by checking their checkboxes.

3. **Configure Apache to Use the Repository:**

   - Navigate to your XAMPP installation folder.
   - Go to `apache` folder and then `conf`.
   - Open `httpd.conf` file with a text editor.
   - Locate the lines for `DocumentRoot` and `Directory` and change them to point to your repository's directory. For example:
     ```
     DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/repository"
     <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/repository">
     ```

4. **Start Apache and MySQL Services:**

   Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

5. **Access the Website:**

   Open your preferred web browser and navigate to `http://localhost` to access your website.

## Usage

1. Specify the database connection details (e.g., host, port, credentials) and select the desired database.

2. Provide a SQL query to extract the required data from the database. The query can be customized to filter, aggregate, or manipulate the data as needed.

3. Define a LaTeX template through Python that serves as the blueprint for the document. This template includes placeholders for dynamically inserted data elements.

4. The program executes the SQL query, retrieves the data from the database, and populates the LaTeX template with the fetched data. It generates a complete LaTeX document ready for compilation.

5. The program compiles the generated LaTeX document using `pdflatex` with a local LaTeX compiler (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX) to obtain the final output in PDF format.
